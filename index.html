      <h1>The Prophecy Revealed: Full Breakdown of The 12 Tribes of Israel</h1>
    </header>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
      <p>A lot of people may call themselves names like African Americans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Indians, Pacific Islanders, Christians, Catholics, etc. But what I wanted to show is, this isn't the case. That the Bible shows us and gives us the understanding of the different families of the earth, and how the Heathen Nations would take it upon themselves to deceive those nationalities of people which are living at the bottom in the earth today, or whom you might call, the minority. Humble yourselves and those that have an ear to hear, listen. This knowledge has been hidden, but the Most High God said in the last days, knowledge would increase (Daniel 12:4) &amp; that His people would soon begin to wake up to who they are and everything going on around them.</p>
      <p>This knowledge is so very important in our learning, because if we can't even identify ourselves in the Bible, how can we be so sure our pastors, our preachers, our teachers are giving us the correct information, how can we be sure they were given the correct information. In slavery our people were forced to undergo mandatory Christian Instruction on Sunday. How do we know we are following the Bible for what it says? Revelations 12:9 says Satan has deceived the world. Key term “Has”. So how do we know we haven't been deceived? Continue reading and you will see, you are in the Bible, and the Bible is not just a religious book, but a history book, our forefather's book, our book.</p>

      <p><strong>James 4:10:</strong> "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."</p>
      <p><strong>Matthew 18:4:</strong> "Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."</p>
      <p><strong>Isaiah 28:9:</strong> "Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts."</p>

    <!-- The 12 Lost Tribes of Israel -->
    <section id="lost-tribes">
      <h2>The 12 Lost Tribes of Israel</h2>
      <p><strong>Who are the Lost Tribes of Israel?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Hosea 4:1:</strong> "Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land."</p>
      <p>Religion is throughout the entire world, there are churches on almost every corner, although the Most High God says there is no knowledge of Him in the land. This is because the truth of Him is not being taught throughout the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Colossians 1:26:</strong> "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"</p>
      <p>According to Hosea 6:1 God says He would raise His people in this very time, in the last days which we are in, He would reveal His mysteries which have been hidden for ages unto the saints, and they would soon realize who they were and cleave to Him.</p>

    <!-- Understanding the Israelites -->
    <section id="israelites">
      <h2>Brief Understanding of Who are the Israelites</h2>
      <p>Noah had 3 sons, Ham, Shem, &amp; Japheth. Ham was the Progenitor of the African races, not the Negroes (Zondervan Bible Dictionary). Japheth became the progenitor of the Asians. Shem became the progenitor of many races of nations. Through Shem, Abraham came forth. The Most High God said through Abraham He would establish His chosen seed and through them all the nations of the world would be blessed. Abraham had Issac and Isaac had Jacob. Jacob’s name was changed to Israel because he had an encounter with an angel. Jacob/Israel had 12 sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Benjamin, Asher, Zebulon, Dan, Issachar, Joseph, Gad, and Naphtali. Joseph’s sons Ephraim &amp; Manessah took Joseph’s place and became 2 individual tribes &amp; Dan’s children’s unrighteousness caused them to become Gentiles. These are Jacob’s 12 sons and they were God’s people, the Jews &amp; still are His people.</p>
      <p><strong>Matthew 10:5:</strong> "These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:"</p>
      <p><strong>Matthew 10:6:</strong> "But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</p>
      <p>Christ came, for the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel, the Israelites (Matthew 15:24) because they were lost also. He sent His disciples first to preach to the Jews who were lost because salvation is given to the Jew first, then to the Gentiles. If the Jews were not awakened into the truth of Christ, the Gentiles would have never gotten it, because the Jews must be a light to the world. But they were lost, as we are today, why?</p>

    <!-- Curses and Consequences -->
    <section id="curses">
      <h2>Curses and Their Consequences</h2>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:21:</strong> "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation."</p>
      <p>So because the Israelites did many foolish things before God, He put a foolish nation above us—a nation which only thrives on money and the blood, sweat and tears of their slaves.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 7:6:</strong> "For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth."</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 7:7:</strong> "The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:"</p>
      <p>The Jews were God’s chosen people, this is because God promised Abraham that through his seed all nations would be blessed throughout the whole earth. He chose us because we were the only righteous people on the earth and He dealt only with us and because we fell as a nation, the Gentiles receive salvation, as long as they follow Christ (Romans 11).</p>
      <p><strong>Psalm 147:19:</strong> "He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel."</p>
      <p><strong>Psalm 147:20:</strong> "He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD."</p>
      <p>The Most High God only dealt with the Jews. After He brought them through the Red Sea, He gave them the commandments. He gave no other nation the commandments. He freed no other nation from the Egyptian captivity. He brought us through the Wilderness for 40 years and gave our forefathers the land of Milk and Honey.</p>

    <!-- Identifying the Israelites -->
    <section id="identifying">
      <h2>Identifying the Israelites</h2>
      <p>One way to find out who in the world today are the real Jews is by matching nations of people up with the curses. Some might say the real Jews are the people in Israel today.... (Revelations 2:9, 3:9 says otherwise). So what are the curses?</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:15:</strong> "But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:"</p>
    </section>

    <!-- More on the Curses -->
    <section id="more-curses">
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:21:</strong> "The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it."</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:22:</strong> "The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish."</p>
      <p>Any land that the Jews possessed would be taken from them; they would undergo fevers, inflammation, death, destruction—and they would be pursued until large numbers of these people would perish.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:25:</strong> "The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth."</p>
      <p>They would be smitten before their enemies, and because of this when one is smitten several more shall run for their lives. They shall also be removed into all kingdoms of the earth—that is KEY.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:30:</strong> "Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof."</p>
      <p>So our woman would be taken and raped by other men; the chosen people would build houses and towns and they would not dwell in them. They'll plant gardens, vineyards, all sorts of things, but would not gather its fruits, its grapes for themselves.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:31:</strong> "Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them."</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:32:</strong> "Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand."</p>
      <p>Our animals would be taken away from us—our ox, our sheep, our asses. Our sons and daughters would be taken from us and given unto other people, stolen. Although we wouldn't have any power in our hands whatsoever to get them back, we would long for them all the days of our lives.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:37:</strong> "And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee."</p>
      <p>They would be called other names. For example, Indian, Wild man, African American, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, American, Nigger, Coon.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:41:</strong> "Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity."</p>
      <p>Their sons and daughters would go into captivity.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:48:</strong> "Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee."</p>
      <p>A yoke of iron upon thy neck. It's all starting to come together now, right? If not, these next verses will bring it home for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:49:</strong> "The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;"</p>
      <p>God would send a nation far from where the real Jews would be, who are represented by the eagle, and a nation whose tongue the people would not understand, against them. If you look back, Indians did not understand the Europeans; Spanish was forced on all of Central and South America, and Black people never spoke the language of Queen Elisabeth.</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:64:</strong> "And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone."</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:66:</strong> "And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:"</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:67:</strong> "In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see."</p>
      <p><strong>Deuteronomy 28:68:</strong> "And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you"</p>
      <p>The word “Egypt” in this verse means Bondage. The words “bondmen” and “bondwoman” mean woman slaves and men slaves. So the Lord would bring HIS people into slavery/bondage with ships, and they would be sold as slave men and slave women. The ONLY PEOPLE I can think of who went on slave ships were the Blacks, Haitians &amp; Jamaicans during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. So, am I trying to tell you the Indians, Indigenous people in North, Central, &amp; South America, like the Guatemalans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, &amp; American Negroes are the real Jews? Yes. So who are those people in Israel today? One curse stated we would never see our land again. Also check this out: (Never see war when we in our land)</p>
